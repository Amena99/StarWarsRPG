# JQuery Star Wars Game
This game is built with basic foundations of JQuery and JavaScript. The player begins by selecting a character to play as, and an oppponent to fight. The player uses the "Attack" button to fight the opponent but deducting health points. If the first opponent has been defeated, the player may go on to fight the second and third. Defeating all three opponents results in a win for the player. Depleting health points results in a loss. 

The program utilizes JavaScript objects to store characters' properties such as health points, attack power, and counter attack power. Each fight combination is a method in the character's object. By utilizing multiple functions the program tracks and health points, attack power, and checks for defeats and wins.
